# Big Data Projects in R

This repository contains a series of projects related to data analysis using R in the context of applied mathematics. The projects are organized by guides and address different aspects of data analysis, from central measures to graphics and simplex analysis.

## Guides

### Guide 00: Matrices
- **File:** `Kissling_guide_00_Matrices.R`
- **Description:** This project addresses the management and analysis of matrices in R, exploring various operations and techniques applied to matrix datasets.

### Guide 01: Central Measures
- **File:** `Kissling_guide_1_Central-Measures.R`
- **Description:** This guide studies central measures, such as mean, median, and mode, applied to datasets using R.

### Guide 02: Dispersion Measures
- **File:** `Kissling_Guide_02_Dispersion-Measures.R`
- **Description:** This project explores dispersion measures, which help understand the variability of data, using statistical tools in R.

### Guide 03: Graphics
- **File:** `Kissling_Guide_03_Graphics.R`
- **Description:** Here, data visualization is analyzed through the generation of different types of graphics using R, aiming to effectively communicate the information contained in datasets.

### Guide 04: Simplex Analysis
- **File:** `Kissling_Guide_04_Simplex.R`
- **Description:** This project focuses on simplex analysis, a technique used in linear optimization, exploring its implementation in R and its application in linear programming problems.

### CO2 per Capita Prediction in Argentina
- **Description:** This project analyzes CO2 emissions per capita in Argentina over the years and makes a prediction for the years 2017 and 2018. It uses a dataset stored in `co2_perCapita.csv` and an R script for analysis and prediction generation.
- **Files:**
  - `co2_perCapita.csv`: Dataset containing information about CO2 emissions per capita in Argentina.
  - `EFI_KISSLING.html`: HTML file generated by the R script containing visualizations and analysis results.
  - `EFI_KISSLING.R`: R script performing the analysis of CO2 emissions per capita and generating predictions for the years 2017 and 2018.
  - `EFI_KISSLING.Rmd`: R Markdown document including code and analysis narrative.
  - `Prediction_17.18.odt`: Document summarizing the predictions made for the years 2017 and 2018.
  - `.Rhistory`: R history file recording commands and results from previous sessions.
